About: Multi-chatroom web app that allows users to chat with others in real time. 

CREATIVE PORTION:
1. The open chat rooms are constantly monitored so if a room is empty (zero users inside), the room will be deleted and removed from the open chat room list.  
2. Creator of rooms may delete rooms. Deleting the room will result in everyone currently in the room being kicked out of the chat, and the room wil be removed from the open chat room list.
3. Creator of rooms may pass on their creator privileges (ban, kick out, delete, change creator) to another existing user in the current room. 
4. If the creator has disconnected from the app, creator privileges will automatically be passed on to another existing user in the room. 

ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION EXPLANATIONS:
1. A user must sign in first before being able to see anything else.
